Basic commands:
- date : gives us today's date
- ls : gives us a list of the contents in a specific directory
	-ls -lA : lists hidden files
- pwd : prints the exact path of a directory
- cd : changes directory
	- cd . : represents the directory I am in
	- cd .. : represents the parent directory
- touch : creates a new empty file
- mkdir : creates a new directory
- rmdir : removes a directory (only if it is empty)
- rm : removes a file
	- -r : recursively, it does what the command before it says
		Example:
					- rm -r removes all the files in a directory as well as the directory 
					itself
	- -i : asks for confirmation to remove a file
	- -f : removes any file, even "write protected" ones
- cp : it copies a file. It takes to parmeters: file to be copied and new file to be created
- mv : moves files and also renames files. It takes to parameters : file to be moved and where to move it
	   if we don't provide destination, it will simply rename the file

- find : finds specific files
- grep : look into files for specific stff (it's like find but inside files)
- cd ~/Music find . -name *.mp3 -print > myMusic.txt
	with this we can : "find" in "." a mp3 file whose "-name" would be"*", ""-print" it and then create ">" a txt file with the info!
- grep ??
- chmod : change permissions in a file (read, write, excecute...) from 			a class(user, group, all)
-echo : it can be used to shave short strings into a file
